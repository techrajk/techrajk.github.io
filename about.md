Currently, I am a Research Scholar at Shobhit University, NCR.
The topic of my Ph.D is related to containing mis-information using Deep Learning(AI).

I'm an experienced Big Data Engineer and Trainer. In the past, had worked on cuttting-edge technologies like Spark, Hadoop, Docker & EJBs for MNCs. 

My recent interest is in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision as they are disruting the industry and applying them in every aspect of our lives would be revolutionary.

Most of the code that I have developed is on my <a href="https://github.com/techrajk"  target="_blank">github</a>, just check it out.

I am looking for some Deep Learning research internship or some opportunity as Data Scientist.

I would love to teach Data Science and Deep Learning.

Competing at Kaggle always keep me on my toes.
